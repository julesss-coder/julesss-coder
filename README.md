- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Julia (@julesss-coder)!
- ðŸ‘€ I am a Web developer with 2 yearsâ€™ experience in front end web development, and a love of problem-solving. So far, I've created websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and React. I also have some experience in Java, SQL, and PHP.
- ðŸŒ± In my spare time, I like to read (classics, science fiction), and listen to podcasts (libertarianism, Austrian school of economics). Apart from that, I spend as much time as possible in nature.
