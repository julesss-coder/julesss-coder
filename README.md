- 👋 Hi, I’m Julia (@julesss-coder)!
- 👀 I’m working hard on getting really good at programming. I am currently studying to be a full-stack web developer (I'm in a bootcamp at Altcademy), but I also enjoy solving problems on LeetCode. Sometimes I am overwhelmed with all the fascinating stuff there is to learn about programming and computer science! Recently, I started reading and watching the course materials for the classic "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" (by Abelson and Sussman, 1996) and I love the way they clearly explain the foundational ideas of programming! Reading and working through this book in full will be my next challenge.
- 🌱 In my free time, I love being in nature, sports, reading classic novels and learning about the Austrian school of economics.
