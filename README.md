- 👋 Hi, I’m Julia (@julesss-coder)!
- 👀 Working as a software developer offers me the opportunity to independently develop and implement solutions – a freedom I particularly appreciate, as it helps me maximize my productivity and creativity. Currently, I am focused on better understanding Bitcoin as a technology, with the goal of contributing to open-source projects that advance the Bitcoin ecosystem in the future.
