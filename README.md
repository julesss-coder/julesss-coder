- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Julia (@julesss-coder)!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m working hard on getting really good at programming. I am currently studying to be a full-stack web developer (I'm in a bootcamp at Altcademy), but I also enjoy solving problems on LeetCode etc. I'm still in the process of finding out which areas of programming I find the most interesting, though. Sometimes I am overwhelmed with all the fascinating stuff there is to learn about programming and computer science! Recently, I started reading and watching the course materials for the classic "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" (by Abelson and Sussman, 1996) and I love the way they clearly explain the foundational ideas of programming! Reading and working through this book in full will be my next challenge.
- ðŸŒ± In my free time, I love being in nature, sports, reading classic novels and learning about the Austrian school of economics. I am also fascinated with various learning apps that teach subjects I used to hate in school in such a way that I am beginning to like them.
