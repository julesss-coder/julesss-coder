- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Julia (@julesss-coder)!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in getting really good at programming and finding out which fields of programming I enjoy the most.
     Freedom is very important to me, so I enjoy reading about libertarian ideas and the Austrian school of economics. 
     In my free time, I love reading great novels (Jane Austen is one of my favourite writers) and prose (currently on Egon Friedell's 
     "A Cultural History of the Modern Age").
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning programming and problem-solving, as well as building a virtual computer from scratch with Coursera's "From Nand to Tetris" class.
