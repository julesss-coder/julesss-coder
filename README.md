- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Julia (@julesss-coder)!
- ðŸ‘€ I work as a React frontend developer (fully remote). What I like most about my job is the opportunity to independently develop and implement solutions to problems. I particularly appreciate the freedom to work in a way that maximizes my productivity.
- &#x1F39E; [My portfolio] <https://julesss-coder.github.io/personal-portfolio/> <a href="http://example.com/">http://example.com/</a>

- In 2020, I began teaching myself programming. Since then, I have implemented several web development projects (JavaScript, React, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap). Additionally, I have gained experience with Java and SQL. Before my professional reorientation towards IT, I worked as a cultural and knowledge communicator at a museum for art and new technologies.
- ðŸŒ± In my free time, I enjoy reading, listening to podcasts, learning new things, and spending as much time as possible in nature.
