- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Julia (@julesss-coder)!
- ðŸ‘€ I am a front end developer, currently working with React in a fully remote position. In the past, I also gained some experience with Java, SQL, and PHP. In my spare time, I am trying to learn Prolog. I just love learning new things and problem-solving! 
- ðŸŒ± Apart from programming, I love to read (classics, science fiction, books that question my worldview), and to spend as much time as possible in nature.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: julesss@posteo.de
