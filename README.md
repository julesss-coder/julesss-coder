- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Julia (@julesss-coder)!
- ðŸ‘€ I am a React Frontend Developer with a mission to transition towards Fullstack development. What I love most about being a programmer is the opportunity to independently tackle problems and bring solutions to life. I particularly appreciate the freedom to work in a way that maximizes my productivity.

- In 2020, I began teaching myself programming. Since then, I have implemented several web development projects (JavaScript, React, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap). Additionally, I have gained experience with Java and SQL. Before my professional reorientation towards IT, I worked as a cultural and knowledge communicator at a museum for art and new technologies.
- ðŸŒ± In my free time, I enjoy reading, listening to podcasts, learning new things, and spending as much time as possible in nature.
